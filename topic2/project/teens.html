        <h3> The Outsiders </h3>
        <h4> $8.46 </h4>
        <p> No one ever said life was easy. But Ponyboy is pretty sure that he's got things figured out.
            He knows that he can count on his brothers, Darry and Sodapop.
            And he knows that he can count on his friends—true friends who would do anything for him, like Johnny and
            Two-Bit.
            But not on much else besides trouble with the Socs, a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a good time is
            beating up on “greasers” like Ponyboy.
            At least he knows what to expect—until the night someone takes things too far.

                Susan Eloise Hinton's career as an author began while she was still a student at Will Rogers High School
                in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
                Disturbed by the divisions among her schoolmates into two groups--the Greasers and the Socs--Hinton
                wrote The Outsiders,
                an honest, sometimes shocking novel told from the point of view of an orphaned 14-year-old Greaser named
                Ponyboy Curtis.
                Since her narrator was male, it was decided that Hinton use only her first initials so as not to put off
                boys who would not normally read books written by women.

        <h3> The Hunger Games </h3>
        <h4> $13.99 </h4>
        <p>
            Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . . In the ruins
            of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve
            outlying districts.
            The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one
            girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death
            on live TV.
            Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's
            place in the Games.
            But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature.
            Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making
            choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.

            Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four,
            Privet Drive.
            Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly
            aunt and uncle.
            Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with
            some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
            Wizardry.
            An incredible adventure is about to begin!
