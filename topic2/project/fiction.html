            Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel. 
            A startling and haunting novel, 1984 creates an imaginary world that is completely
            convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the novel’s hold on the imaginations 
            of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not 
            lessen, with the passage of time.

                George Orwell is one of England's most famous writers and social commentators. 
                Among his works are the classic political satire Animal Farm and the dystopian nightmare vision Nineteen Eighty-Four. 
                Orwell was also a prolific essayist, and it is for these works that he was perhaps best known during his lifetime.
