                John Richard Hersey (June 17, 1914 – March 24, 1993) was an American writer and journalist.
                He is considered one of the earliest practitioners of the so-called New Journalism, in which
                storytelling techniques of fiction are adapted to non-fiction reportage.

        <p> A president who governed a divided country has much to teach us in a twenty-first-century moment of polarization and political crisis. 
            Hated and hailed, excoriated and revered, Abraham Lincoln was at the pinnacle of American power when implacable secessionists gave no quarter in a clash of visions
            bound up with money, race, identity, and faith. In him we can see the possibilities of the presidency as well as its limitations.
