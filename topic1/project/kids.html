        <p>
            Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? is a children's picture book published in 1967 by Henry Holt and
            Company, Inc.[1] Written and illustrated by Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle, the book is designed to help
            toddlers associate colors and meanings to objects. The book has been widely praised by parents and teachers
            and placed on several recognition lists.[2] In 2010, the book was briefly banned from Texas’ third grade
            curriculum due to a confusion between author of children’s books Bill Martin Jr, and author of Ethical
            Marxism: The Categorical Imperative of Liberation (Creative Marxism) philosopher Bill Martin.[3]
