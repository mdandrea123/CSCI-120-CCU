                    <p> No one ever said life was easy. But Ponyboy is pretty sure that he's got things figured out.
                        He knows that he can count on his brothers, Darry and Sodapop.
                        And he knows that he can count on his friends—true friends who would do anything for him, like
                        Johnny
                        and
                        Two-Bit.
                        But not on much else besides trouble with the Socs, a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a
                        good
                        time is
                        beating up on “greasers” like Ponyboy.
                        At least he knows what to expect—until the night someone takes things too far.

                            Susan Eloise Hinton's career as an author began while she was still a student at Will Rogers
                            High
                            School
                            in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
                            Disturbed by the divisions among her schoolmates into two groups--the Greasers and the
                            Socs--Hinton
                            wrote The Outsiders,
                            an honest, sometimes shocking novel told from the point of view of an orphaned 14-year-old
                            Greaser
                            named
                            Ponyboy Curtis.
                            Since her narrator was male, it was decided that Hinton use only her first initials so as
                            not to
                            put
                            off
                            boys who would not normally read books written by women.

                        outlying districts.
                        The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one

                        Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take

                        place in the Games.
                        But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature.
                        Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start
                        making
                        choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.

                            Suzanne Collins has had a successful and prolific career writing for children's television.
                            She has worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit
                            Clarissa
                            Explains It All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo.
                            Collins made her mark in children's literature with the New York Times bestselling five-book
                            series
                            for

                            In the award-winning The Hunger Games trilogy, Collins continues to explore the effects of
                            war
                            and

                            Collins lives with her family in Connecticut.
